      <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
      <p>Money Buddy was created as a solution to a problem that my girlfriend and I have been having, which is that we are never on the same page about finances.</p>
      <p>We had been storing our financial information in a Google Sheet, which works alright for a temporary fix,
        but is not that great as a long-term solution (I mean, unless you really like spreadsheets).</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        So I decided to build a simple web app that would allow us to track our finances together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app allows you to track your income and expenses, set budgets, and integrates with most 
        banks in the United statements through Plaid to automatically import transactions.
